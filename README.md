# Testing Functions with Jest

Welcome to our testing repository! Here, we practice testing JavaScript functions using Jest, a delightful JavaScript testing framework. Jest provides a simple and intuitive way to write tests and ensure the correctness of our code.

## Why Test?

Testing functions is essential to ensure that they behave as expected under different scenarios. By writing tests, you can:

- Catch bugs early in the development process.
- Verify that your functions produce the correct output.
- Refactor code with confidence, knowing that existing functionality remains intact.

Happy testing!
